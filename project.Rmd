## 2. PROJECT REQUIREMENT
### 2.1 Introduction to the project
Spotify is the most well-known music streaming app in the world, users can access millions of songs and also many podcasts around the world. Nowadays, Spotify can be found on almost every device, especially among the millennials, because of its multi-platform apps and free to use.

Spotify is free, but for more convenient features the user can subscribe to Spotify Premium which the minimum cost around $10 per month. The features that the user can get as the premium user is the ability to disable ads and also unlimited songs skip. For this project, we are going to use Spotify daa to do some analysis.

### 2.2 Problems need to be solved
Spotify offer a dataset of all daily hit charts curated by Spotify that is published on Kaggle website ( https://kaggle.com ). The data will contain top 100 song from 2010 until 2019 with xslx data format and total 1000 total record for the past ten years. This dataset is still unprocessed and there is more room to do more exploratory and predictive data analysis.


### 2.3  Data analysis specifications
The objective of this system is to read the data in analysis manner with this functionality:

* Get top popular song for each year
* Get top popular song genre for each year
* Get top popular artist for each year
* Get average duration each year
* Get artist which appeared on the charts maximum number of times
* Predict top genre next year

### 2.4  Project scope
The project will be revolving around descriptive and predictive analysis on Spotify. We are going to use R Programming as the programming language and R Studio as the IDE. Later will be delivered as HTML document generated by R Markdown.

## 3. DATA PREPARATION
### 3.1 Data acquiring

```{r}
df<-read.csv(file = "Spotify 2010 - 2019 Top 100.csv",header = TRUE, sep=",")
head(df,5)
sapply(df,class)
```
### 3.2 Data Cleaning
Remove NAN value
```{r}
df<-read.csv(file = "Spotify 2010 - 2019 Top 100.csv",header = TRUE, sep=",")
head(df,5)
```

### 3.3 Data Transformation

### 3.4 Dataset for analysis










This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
